# JavaScript Implementation

The interactivity and functionality of this portfolio are powered by JavaScript. Below are some key aspects of the JavaScript code used in this project:

## Side Navigation

The side navigation (sidenav) allows users to navigate through different sections of the portfolio. The `openNav()` function is responsible for opening the side navigation when the user clicks the menu button. It animates the display and position of the navigation elements.

The `closeNav()` function is used to close the side navigation. It animates the navigation elements out of view and adjusts their display properties.

## Section Options

The portfolio includes three sections in the 'About' page: 'About Me,' 'About Skills,' and 'About Education.' JavaScript is used to toggle the visibility of these sections when the corresponding options are clicked. Progress bars are animated dynamically when the 'About Skills' and 'About Education' options are selected.

## Theme Switching

The portfolio features a theme switcher that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. The `setTheme()` function is triggered when the theme container is clicked. It dynamically updates CSS variables to change the color scheme and adjusts the theme-related styles.

Feel free to explore the `index.js` file in this repository to dive deeper into the JavaScript implementation.
